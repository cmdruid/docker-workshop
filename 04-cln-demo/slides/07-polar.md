# Working with Polar

Polar is a docker-based tool for creating a simulated lightning network.

* Spin up multiple nodes and connect them with the click of a button.

* Supports the three main implementations (LND, CLN, and Eclair).

* Slick UI for easily opening and funding channels between nodes. 

* We can connect our node to the polar network and test against other nodes.

<!-- Notes:
  * Cover how our node connects to the polar network in docker.
  * Cover the RPC connection to the bitcoin backend in polar.
