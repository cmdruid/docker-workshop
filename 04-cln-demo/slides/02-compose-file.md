# Docker Compose

* A compose file replaces `docker run` for configuring and starting a container.

* A compose file can orchestrate multiple docker containers.

* When you make changes to the `compose.yml` file and restart, docker compose will auto-magically reconfigure your containers.

* A compose file can create networks and volumes, plus connect containers to each other.
